# Agent-Based-Approach-To-Routing-Optimisation

Adapting from the Kaggle competition ‘Santa’s Stolen Sleigh’, it is aimed to apply an agent-based reinforcement learning model to assist Santa in his gift delivery route planning.

The goal is to deliver the assigned list of gifts in the batch in the most efficient manner. Efficiency is defined by achieving through multiple objectives – (1) Weight control and (2) Travel distance minimization.

At first glance this would appear to be a trivial project but the parallels with real world challenges are easy to draw. The comparisons to the travelling salesperson is a natural one but with the advent of drone delivery of packages and parcels brings a new dimension to an old challenge.
